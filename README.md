# Oh My OpenCode

You're juggling Claude Code, Codex, random OSS models. Configuring workflows. Debugging agents.

We did the work. Tested everything. Kept what actually shipped.

Install OmO. Type `ultrawork`. Done.

## The Bet

We're betting on a future where models are cheaper, smarter, and no single provider dominates.
That future is arriving faster than anyone expected.

**Models get cheaper every month.** What cost $20 last year costs $2 now. The race to the bottom is real, and we're here for it.
**Models get smarter every month.** Today's cheap model beats last year's flagship. The gap between frontier and affordable is collapsing.
**No one wins.** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Alibaba - they're all building incredible models. The future isn't locked to one provider. It's a multi-model world.

We built for that future.

Sisyphus doesn't care if he's running on Claude, Kimi, or GLM. He picks the right model for the task. Frontend work? Kimi K2.5. Deep reasoning? Claude Opus. Code generation? GPT-5.3 Codex. The architecture treats models as interchangeable commodities, not sacred cows.

This gets more valuable as models specialize. When Gemini dominates visual tasks and Qwen crushes long-context, we plug them in. Zero rewrites. Zero lock-in.

Anthropic wants you locked in. We're building for the open market.

The harness that wins isn't the one married to a single model. It's the one that rides them all.

## Installation

### For Humans

Copy and paste this prompt to your LLM agent (Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, etc.):

```
Install and configure oh-my-opencode by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode/refs/heads/master/docs/guide/installation.md
```

Or read the [Installation Guide](docs/guide/installation.md), but seriously, let an agent do it. Humans fat-finger configs.

### For LLM Agents

Fetch the installation guide and follow it:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode/refs/heads/master/docs/guide/installation.md
```

---

## Skip This README

We're past the era of reading docs. Just paste this into your agent:

```
Read this and tell me why it's not just another boilerplate: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode/refs/heads/dev/README.md
```

## Highlights

### 🪄 `ultrawork`

You're actually reading this? Wild.

Install. Type `ultrawork` (or `ulw`). Done.

Everything below, every feature, every optimization, you don't need to know it. It just works.

Even only with following subscriptions, ultrawork will work well (this project is not affiliated, this is just personal recommendation):
- [ChatGPT Subscription ($20)](https://chatgpt.com/)
- [Kimi Code Subscription ($0.99) (*only this month)](https://www.kimi.com/membership/pricing?track_id=5cdeca93-66f0-4d35-aabb-b6df8fcea328)
- [GLM Coding Plan ($10)](https://z.ai/subscribe)
- If you are eligible for pay-per-token, using kimi and gemini models won't cost you that much.
- There are some projects like [quotio](https://github.com/nguyenphutrong/quotio), [cliproxyapi](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) too. These might violate some provider's ToS (or not) but some of our community users are using it.

### Discipline Agents

<table><tr>
<td align="center"><img src=".github/assets/sisyphus.png" height="300" /></td>
<td align="center"><img src=".github/assets/hephaestus.png" height="300" /></td>
</tr></table>

**Sisyphus** (`claude-opus-4-6` / **`kimi-k2.5`** / **`glm-5`** ) is your main orchestrator. He plans, delegates to specialists, and drives tasks to completion with aggressive parallel execution. He does not stop halfway.

**Hephaestus** (`gpt-5.3-codex`) is your autonomous deep worker. Give him a goal, not a recipe. He explores the codebase, researches patterns, and executes end-to-end without hand-holding. *The Legitimate Craftsman.*

**Prometheus** (`claude-opus-4-6` / **`kimi-k2.5`** / **`glm-5`** ) is your strategic planner. Interview mode: it questions, identifies scope, and builds a detailed plan before a single line of code is touched.

Every agent is tuned to its model's specific strengths. No manual model-juggling. [Learn more →](docs/guide/overview.md)

> Anthropic [blocked OpenCode because of us.](https://x.com/thdxr/status/2010149530486911014) That's why Hephaestus is called "The Legitimate Craftsman." The irony is intentional.
>
> We run best on Opus, but Kimi K2.5 + GPT-5.3 Codex already beats vanilla Claude Code. Zero config needed.

### Agent Orchestration

When Sisyphus delegates to a subagent, it doesn't pick a model. It picks a **category**. The category maps automatically to the right model:

| Category             | What it's for                      |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `visual-engineering` | Frontend, UI/UX, design            |
| `deep`               | Autonomous research + execution    |
| `quick`              | Single-file changes, typos         |
| `ultrabrain`         | Hard logic, architecture decisions |

Agent says what kind of work. Harness picks the right model. You touch nothing.

### Claude Code Compatibility

You dialed in your Claude Code setup. Good.

Every hook, command, skill, MCP, plugin works here unchanged. Full compatibility, including plugins.

### World-Class Tools for Your Agents

LSP, AST-Grep, Tmux, MCP actually integrated, not duct-taped together.

- **LSP**: `lsp_rename`, `lsp_goto_definition`, `lsp_find_references`, `lsp_diagnostics`. IDE precision for every agent
- **AST-Grep**: Pattern-aware code search and rewriting across 25 languages
- **Tmux**: Full interactive terminal. REPLs, debuggers, TUI apps. Your agent stays in session
- **MCP**: Web search, official docs, GitHub code search. All baked in

### Skill-Embedded MCPs

MCP servers eat your context budget. We fixed that.

Skills bring their own MCP servers. Spin up on-demand, scoped to task, gone when done. Context window stays clean.

### Codes Better. Hash-Anchored Edits

The harness problem is real. Most agent failures aren't the model. It's the edit tool.

> *"None of these tools give the model a stable, verifiable identifier for the lines it wants to change... They all rely on the model reproducing content it already saw. When it can't - and it often can't - the user blames the model."*
>
> <br/>- [Can Bölük, The Harness Problem](https://blog.can.ac/2026/02/12/the-harness-problem/)

Inspired by [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi), we implemented **Hashline**. Every line the agent reads comes back tagged with a content hash:

```
11#VK: function hello() {
22#XJ:   return "world";
33#MB: }
```

The agent edits by referencing those tags. If the file changed since the last read, the hash won't match and the edit is rejected before corruption. No whitespace reproduction. No stale-line errors.

Grok Code Fast 1: **6.7% → 68.3%** success rate. Just from changing the edit tool.

### Deep Initialization. `/init-deep`

Run `/init-deep`. It generates hierarchical `AGENTS.md` files:

```
project/
├── AGENTS.md              ← project-wide context
├── src/
│   ├── AGENTS.md          ← src-specific context
│   └── components/
│       └── AGENTS.md      ← component-specific context
```

Agents auto-read relevant context. Zero manual management.

### Planning. Prometheus

Complex task? Don't prompt and pray.

`/start-work` calls Prometheus. **Interviews you like a real engineer**, identifies scope and ambiguities, builds a verified plan before touching code. Agent knows what it's building before it starts.

### Skills

Skills aren't just prompts. Each brings:

- Domain-tuned system instructions
- Embedded MCP servers, on-demand
- Scoped permissions. Agents stay in bounds

Built-ins: `playwright` (browser automation), `git-master` (atomic commits, rebase surgery), `frontend-ui-ux` (design-first UI).

Add your own: `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md` or `~/.config/opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

## Uninstallation

To remove oh-my-opencode:

1. **Remove the plugin from your OpenCode config**

   Edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `opencode.jsonc`) and remove `"oh-my-opencode"` from the `plugin` array:

   ```bash
   # Using jq
   jq '.plugin = [.plugin[] | select(. != "oh-my-opencode")]' \
       ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json > /tmp/oc.json && \
       mv /tmp/oc.json ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
   ```

2. **Remove configuration files (optional)**

   ```bash
   # Remove user config
   rm -f ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode.json ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode.jsonc

   # Remove project config (if exists)
   rm -f .opencode/oh-my-opencode.json .opencode/oh-my-opencode.jsonc
   ```

3. **Verify removal**

   ```bash
   opencode --version
   # Plugin should no longer be loaded
   ```

## Author's Note

**Want the philosophy?** Read the [Ultrawork Manifesto](docs/manifesto.md).

---

I burned through $24K in LLM tokens on personal projects. Tried every tool. Configured everything to death. OpenCode won.

Every problem I hit, the fix is baked into this plugin. Install and go.

If OpenCode is Debian/Arch, OmO is Ubuntu/[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/).

Heavy influence from [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com) and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/overview). Features ported, often improved. Still building. It's **Open**Code.

Other harnesses promise multi-model orchestration. We ship it. Stability too. And features that actually work.

I'm this project's most obsessive user:
- Which model has the sharpest logic?
- Who's the debugging god?
- Who writes the best prose?
- Who dominates frontend?
- Who owns backend?
- What's fastest for daily driving?
- What are competitors shipping?

This plugin is the distillation. Take the best. Got improvements? PRs welcome.

**Stop agonizing over harness choices.**
**I'll research, steal the best, and ship it here.**

Sounds arrogant? Have a better way? Contribute. You're welcome.

No affiliation with any project/model mentioned. Just personal experimentation.

99% of this project was built with OpenCode. I don't really know TypeScript. **But I personally reviewed and largely rewrote this doc.**
